Slime Mold Network

This is an algorithms based project where we attempted to develop a path-finding algorithm that emulates the one found in slime mold transport pathways. The slime mold networks have great efficiency and robustness in that they minimize total lengths of networks and distances between nodes while also maximizing the connectivity. This ensures that the network will remain intact in case of unforeseen disconnections in the network.

The standard graph algorithms such as Prim's and Dijkstra's were implemented using Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's Algorithms API which can be found here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
